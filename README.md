# AccounTwin

## Inspiration
COVID-19 has held us hostage in our own homes. However, it is also an opportunity to reflect upon ourselves, finally master that skill you've always wanted to, read that book you've been ignoring on your bookshelf, watch that movie you never got the chance to watch. Staying productive isn't as easy as it sounds though. Sometimes all you need is that ounce of motivation. AccounTwin presents you the opportunity to grab it!

We as a team agreed over the fact that it would be great to be paired with someone 
when completing our goals ( like learning a new skill! ) a partner will not only 
make it fun but at the same time will introduce accountability, and a flavor 
of competition, boosting our productivity while we strive to complete our goal together.

## What it does

Our app pairs two users with a similar goal.
Users can send requests by scrolling through a feed of anonymous profiles based on their goals.
On a match! you can further communicate with your partner and disclose the essential information to 
communicate and fulfill your goals together!!
The incentive mechanism makes sure a pair successfully completing their goal is rewarded!

## How we built it

We used the MERN stack for web app, two of our team members were working on the front-end while the
other two were working on the backend part. Not everybody was comfortable with what they were working, so 
we pulled it through together!

We started from scratch, most of the frontend team's work comprised of React and Designing, MongoDB, GraphQl along with integration were the task of backend team.

## Challenges we ran into

We Of course ran into the challenge of connecting to MongoDB posting our first user data.
Since most of the team was pretty new to MERN so Router and Routing stayed surprising for us!
And occasional merge conflicts kept showing, uniting the frontend and backend team!

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
Every member of the team had something new to learn. Regardless of the challenges we ran into the team communicated effectively.
## What We learned
From learning a new development tool from scratch to running into new issues while using familiar tools, every member of the team has experienced it all. For 2/4 of the members, it was their first experience working as a remote team.
## What's next for AccounTwin
The team will continue developing AccounTwin and add features such as point-based incentive mechanism for users and leaderboard.
